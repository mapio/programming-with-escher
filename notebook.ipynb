    "\n",
    "In such work the [Square Limit](https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/square-limit) *woodcut* by [Maurits Cornelis Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) is reconstructed from a set of *primitive* graphical objects suitably *composed* by means of a *functional language*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the approach will be somehow different: first of all because our recipients will be students new to computer science (instead of fellow researchers), but also because besides recalling the fundamental concepts of abstraction levels (and barriers), primitives and composition, present in the original paper, we will here also take the opportunity to introduce some (albeit to some extent elementary) considerations on algebra and geometry, programming and recursion (and perhaps discuss some implementation details).\n",

    "This work is to be considered *very preliminary*, it is not yet structured in a series of lectures, nor it is worked out the level at which every topic is to be presented, according to the age (or previous knowledge) of the students. The language and detail level used here is intended for instructors and teachers, and the various topics will be listed as mere hints, not yet as a viable and ready to use syllabus.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last remark, before actually beginning with the notes, the code of this notebook is very loosely derived from previous \"implementations\" of Functional Geometry such as [Shashi Gowda](https://github.com/shashi)'s [Julia version](https://shashi.github.io/ijulia-notebooks/funcgeo/) and  [Micah Hahn](https://github.com/micahhahn)'s [Hasjell version](https://github.com/micahhahn/FunctionalGeometry) (containing the [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) description of the Escher fish used here). I decided to rewrote such code in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), a simple and widespread language, to make it easier for instructors to adopt it.\n",
